            <h2>Growing Up</h2>
            <p>
                For most of my life, my dad was a Surveyor. He always worked around computers. I knew how to use a computer before I knew much else about life. My dad always talks about how good with computers I was when I was young, to the point of teaching him how to do things and figuring out solutions to common problems myself. I always wanted to work in a tech or math related field because of how he raised me. At this point, it wouldn't make sense for me not to be in a tech career!
            </p>
            <h2>High School and College</h2>
            <p>
                In high school I did a couple coding courses, mainly centered around HTML. Unfortunately, as you may be able to tell, I didn't retain much of the knowledge, mostly because high school was pretty hard for me. Towards the end of high school, I convinced myself I wasn't smart enough to be in the tech field, and completely gave up. About a month before senior year I applied to Mountwest Community and Technical College in Huntington, West Virginia. I attended the school in persuit of a Culinary Arts career. I only attended for about a month before realising that it wasn't for me and dropped out. For years I worked casual customer service job, as defined in <a href="#career-header">My Professional Career</a>. Now, I've realised I'm supposed to be in a tech field, despite my love for the culinary arts. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="career-header">My Professional career</h2>
            <p>
                Up to this point, I've only worked one Tech related job. My first job was Taco Bell, where I started in 2017, a month before my 18th birthday. I worked there until I started college, when I moved to Pizza Hut. After leaving Pizza Hut, I went to Speedway, where I became an assistant manager after only a few months. I left Speedway in November 2018, after having worked there for 11 months. I briefly worked for Starbucks before going back to Speedway as a cashier. In May of 2019 I started working at Ibex. At Ibex, I was a Technical Support Representative. I was answering calls for Frontier, walking customers through fixing their phone, internet, and television service. I learned many things about networking from this job, and after I left Ibex I started applying for other networking jobs. Unfortunately without certs or schooling I couldn't find any jobs in network support, and shortly afterwards I started working at Walmart in the Deli. When COVID hit, the Deli at the Walmart I worked at was closed, and I was fired. I worked various delivery jobs, such as Instacart, DoorDash, and UberEATS, off and on for the past couple years. I got hit with depression hard, barely able to hold down a job due to my mental health having plummeted. The past couple years have been difficult for other reasons on top of this, but these are the main reasons why I view Coding Temple as my second chance. I have a lot riding on my ability to do well in this program!
