            Here I will be talking a little bit about what I want to happen after I graduate Coding Temple, and beyond! You can read a little more about what led me here professionally at <a href="My_Background.html#career-header">My Professional Career</a>.

            <h2>Immediately After</h2>
            <p>
                After Coding temple, I want to find a fulfilling job, preferably remote. I want a job  that means something beyond a tech support or customer service role. My dream job  will be assisting with an app or website in an industry I care about.

            <h2>My Long Term Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I've always dreamed about owning my own business. I've had several ideas for apps I want to make. I might not ever be a successful CEO of a tech company, but that's not really what I want. I just want to put out work that I'm proud of, and that I can live off of without pressure of bills. I don't see programming or any tech field as a get rich quick type of deal. I just think that it would be wonderful to have a career that will last a while and that I can actually be happy in.
